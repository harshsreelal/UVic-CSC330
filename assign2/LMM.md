#### LMM notes

You are to maintain this markdown file to keep notes on the way large language models have helped with the completion of your A2 solution (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, )


##### Phase 1 notes
Did not use an LLM for phase 1.


##### Phase 2 notes
Utilized ChatGPT to help
    - understand how the group (`<g>`) tag works in HTML. Used a section of my code to understand how the syntax would translate into JavaScript.
    - bring the "tooltip" box with language creation year and creator, to the front so it would not be blocked by the paradigm boxes under it.  


##### Phase 3 notes
Utilized ChatGPT to help
    - understand how the transition attribute works in HTML, along with the duration and translate attributes.
